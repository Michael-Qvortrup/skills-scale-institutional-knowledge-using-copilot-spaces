# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management is characterized by structured, role-based workflows that prioritize clarity and agility. The process begins with comprehensive project initiation and chartering, where objectives are defined collaboratively and essential milestones are set. Key personas include project managers, product owners, development team members, and dedicated QA specialists. Each role has clear responsibilities throughout planning, execution, and review phases, ensuring accountability and technical rigor.

Core workflows follow agile practices, organizing work into sprints or iterative cycles. Project managers facilitate planning sessions, backlog refinement, and sprint milestones. Story definition and assignments involve active participation from relevant roles, fostering commitment and shared understanding of deliverables. Regular check-ins and sprint reviews help track progress and address blockers efficiently.

Communication strategies at OctoAcme are designed to be transparent and responsive. The team utilizes synchronous meetings (daily standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives) for collaborative decision-making, complemented by async channels such as shared docs and messaging platforms for rapid information exchange. Documented processes and central repositories provide accessible reference points for all team members, supporting both local and distributed collaboration.

Quality assurance is interwoven with each phase of the workflow. QA specialists set clear acceptance criteria for deliverables and conduct thorough automated and manual testing prior to releases. Feedback and defect reporting loops are rapid, leading to prompt fixes and continuous improvement sessions. Retrospectives occur after each major delivery and are used to surface process enhancements, ensuring that both efficiency and product quality are maintained over time.
